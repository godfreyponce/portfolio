next_action: "Fill in the four template sections on ONE of #38 / #39 / #40, then green-light it (owner pick 2026-08-16). These three were filed in the 2026-08-16 intake session alongside #37 and none carry `ready-for-agent` yet: #38 tactile raised/pressed hover on buttons and social links, #39 expanding footer that opens at page bottom, #40 latest-commit status line in the footer. This is owner-side work, not an agent task — the eligible pool is empty until one of them is green-lit. Still outstanding behind it: #33 cannot be planned as written (its body says Vercel Web Analytics, which silently no-ops on AWS Amplify; pick an Amplify-compatible option and rewrite the body around it first, and `docs/plans/2026-08-11-issue-33.md` is stale against the old body), and #34 (OG share image) needs its four sections too."

# personalWebsite — Project State

Personal portfolio site. Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19 + Tailwind v4 +
Framer Motion. Single page (`app/page.tsx`): Hero → About → StickmanRunner → Timeline →
Education → LossGraph → The Lab → Passions → Footer. Repo: github.com/godfreyponce/portfolio (private).

*Thin snapshot. `next_action` above names the ticket that is up now — start there.
Archive: `docs/HISTORY.md`. Queue: GitHub Issues (`gh issue list`). Protocol: `AGENTS.md`.*

## Now

- Nothing mid-flight. Map issue #35 is pinned; regenerate `docs/decision-map.html`
  at every ticket close (command in AGENTS.md, "Question tickets").
- Pre-existing tree items (owner's, don't touch): unstaged deletion of
  agent_architecture_strategy.md, untracked Icon file.

## Run / verify (do this first)

```bash
pkill -f "next dev"      # ALWAYS kill existing dev servers first; only ONE at a time
npm run dev              # http://localhost:3000
npx tsc --noEmit         # run ONCE at the end of a change, not in a loop
```
No `npm run build` to verify changes; no `npm install` unless the owner asks.
Verify visually via Chrome automation at localhost:3000 (scroll the whole page).

## Gotchas (short form — full detail in docs/HISTORY.md)

- `overflow-x-hidden` on `<main>` kills `position: sticky` — it's `overflow-x-clip` now, don't revert.
- Next 16 needs `images.qualities` in `next.config.ts` for non-75 image qualities.
- Signal project was deliberately removed 2026-07-07 (owner) — don't resurrect from git.
- Backgrounded browser-automation tabs get throttled — fire-and-collect JS + screenshots.
  `setTimeout` also clamps to ~1s there, so sampling a CSS animation on a short interval aliases
  and reads as frozen; use `document.getAnimations()` and set `currentTime` instead.
- Synthetic `mouseenter`/`mouseover` does NOT fire React's `onMouseEnter` (root delegation) —
  verify hover effects with a real cursor (`computer` → `hover`). And never assign `innerHTML`
  inside a React subtree to probe it: the recreated nodes fall out of the fiber tree and lose
  their handlers until reload. Both faked a broken effect on #37.
- `resize_window` refuses bounds on a fullscreen Chrome window — check narrow widths by injecting
  a same-origin iframe (it gets its own viewport for `vw` and media queries).
- Hosting is AWS Amplify, not Vercel — Vercel-only features (Web Analytics, ISR knobs) silently no-op.
